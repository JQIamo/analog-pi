Version 2.5.3

+ Add J9 low profile jumper to disable input offset.
+ Change part number for input offset POT (POT11) to one with low thermal coefficient. Adds ~$15 to BOM cost.

Version 2.5.2

+ Change IUGC capacitance. Remove 15uF and 4.7uF, add 470pF and 150pF
+ Add relay to turn off I_VGA when unlock.
+ Adjust Integral Limiter: change feedback capacitance from 510pF to 1500pF,
  and remove output capacitors
+ Change output impedance of monitor ports (IN_MON, ERR_MON, OUT_MON) from 1kOhm to 20 Ohms
  With 1 kOhm output impedance, monitor signals bandwidth are slower than the actual signal.
  To avoid confusion, using 20 Ohms output impedance makes the monitor ports show actual signals.
  However, output resistors can be damaged if monitor port is shorted-circuit. 

Version 2.5.1

+ Install 2 parallel 100 Ohms at OUT to make 50 Ohms output impedance,
  mitigating impedance mismatch and signal reflections.
+ Change input resistors to 2 parallel 100 Ohms to make it possible to modify input impedance.
  User can choose to install +/-10V 1 MOhm input impedance or +/-10V 50 Ohms input impedance.
+ Change maximum P_GAIN from 3 to 10

Fix issues in version 2.5

+ Correct wiring at regulators L7912 and L7905
+ I_VGA and P_VGA trims cannot zero the output offset.
  Change resistance around trim pot from 10kOhms to 3kOhms.
+ Unable to turn off P_GAIN and I_GAIN completely.
  Control voltage need to be at least -1.0V to turn off.
  Change resistance around external pot from 20kOhms to 10kOhms
  Increase control range to +/-1.7V to make sure that VGA can be completely turned off
+ High frequency signal ~10MHz pass through the integrator and destructive interfere
  with proportional signal
  Change input resistance to Integrator from 1kOhm to 10kOhms to reduce direct transfer signal.
+ Switch MON_IN1 causes oscillation in ERR_MON
  Long trace ERR_MON to LockDector makes LM7171 unstable.
  Install 1kOhm resistor to isolate output from long trace.
+ POT4 Buffer Bandwidth control is too close to output BNC and does not provide gain
  bandwidth limit as expected.  When use in low bandwidth mode, phase margin becomes worse.
  Use high bandwidth mode and install a 3MHz low-pass filter before buffer U18
+ LM7171 in OUTPUT stage has resonant response at 25MHz.
  Long trace PI to LockDector and IntLimiter makes LM7171 unstable
  Install 1kOhm resistor to isolate output from long trace.
+ Switch bouncing (IUGC, LFGL, UNLOCK/LFGL/LOCK).
  Install low-pass filter to mitigate switch bouncing.  Install MOSFETs for driving relays.
+ IN_MON, ERR_MON, OUT_MON overshoot at high frequency when connect 1m cable to oscilloscope.
  Install 1kOhm isolation resistors at output.  Expect monitor ports to drive high impedance load.


Version 2.5
   A prototype that aim to fix low-gain DC-offset issue in version 2.4.1.
The design implements separation between Proportional and Integral signals.
The separation between proportional and integral gives advantages over combined implementation:
+ Proportional signal can be faster and less noisy with less op-amp stages (10MHz->25MHz).
+ Integral signal can have higher open loop gain (80dB->120dB), minimizing DC offset
  from reference signal even with low proportional gain setting.
+ Allowing more flexible setting for slow(integral) and fast(proportional) signals.

This version also implements experimental design for feedback integral limiter, and output limiter.

Fine input offset is removed to use potentiometer knob for integral gain.
