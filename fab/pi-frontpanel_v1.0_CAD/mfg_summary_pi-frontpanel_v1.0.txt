############# Placement  #############

# BOM Items:                    10
# Surface mount placements:     4
# Through hole placements:      11

***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** Part "LED" must be mounted offset from the board surface, 
such that the bottom of the LED is 0.6" (1.5cm) from the board surface.

Placements are on both the top and bottom.
All surface mount placements are on bottom (see centroid file for pick & place).
